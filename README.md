# SmartVision Pro - Real-Time Threat Detection

SmartVision Pro is an advanced real-time computer vision system designed to detect potential security threats such as weapons (guns, knives) and violent actions (fighting, shooting) using a multi-stage pipeline.

##  Features

- **Object Detection**: Identifies persons and weapons (handguns, rifles, knives, etc.) using a fine-tuned **YOLOv11** model.
- **Pose Estimation**: Extracts skeletal landmarks using **MediaPipe** for detailed movement analysis.
- **Action Recognition**: Uses a bidirectional **LSTM** neural network to classify actions (Normal vs. Violence vs. Shooting) based on 30-frame movement sequences.
- **Threat Logic Matrix**: Combines object detection and action recognition to determine threat levels (e.g., *shooting stance* + *gun detected* = **CRITICAL THREAT**).
- **Flexible Input**: Automatically processes video files from a folder or falls back to live webcam feed.
- **Logging**: Records high-priority threats to `logs/threat_alerts.log` and the console.

##  Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repo_url>
    cd smart-vision
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    *It is recommended to use a virtual environment.*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: Ensure you have `torch`, `opencv-python`, `ultralytics`, `mediapipe` installed).*

3.  **Models**:
    Place your trained models in the `models/` directory:
    - `models/yolov11s_fine_tune.pt`
    - `models/lstm_action_recognition_pro.pth`

##  Usage

### 1. Run the Pipeline
The main inference script is located in `pipeline/run_inference.py`.

```bash
python pipeline/run_inference.py
```

### 2. Input Modes
The system automatically determines the input source:
- **Video Mode**: If you place video files (`.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mkv`) in `data/input_videos/`, the system will process them sequentially and save the output to `results/`.
- **Webcam Mode**: If `data/input_videos/` is empty or does not exist, the system switches to the default webcam (`ID 0`).

### 3. Output
- **Visual**: A window showing the video feed with bounding boxes, pose skeletons, and threat status.
- **Video Files**: Processed videos are saved to `results/`.
- **Logs**: Threat alerts (Violence/Shooting) are logged to `logs/threat_alerts.log`.
